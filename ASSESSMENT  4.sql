/* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
Scenario: Marketing wants to estimate CLV based on account tenure and transaction volume (simplified model).
Task: For each customer, assuming the profit_per_transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value, 
calculate:
Account tenure (months since signup)
Total transactions
Estimated CLV (Assume: CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction)
Order by estimated CLV from highest to lowest */
